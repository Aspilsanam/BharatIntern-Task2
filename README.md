OBJECTIVE

The project aims to develop a system that predicts house prices based on average income, area, and market trends. It aims to provide customers with a fast and accurate way to find homes within their budget, eliminating the need for real estate agents and ensuring the best price without getting cheated.

PROPOSED SYSTEM PHASES

Phase 1: Collection of data

Phase 2: Data preprocessing

Phase 3: Training the model

Phase 4: Testing and Integrating with UI

CONCLUSION

Thus the machine learning model to predict the house price based ongiven dataset is executed successfully using xg regressor (a upgraded/slighted boosted form of regular linear regression, this gives lesser error). This model further helps people understand whether this place is more suited for them based on heatmap correlation. It also helps people looking to sell a house at best time for greater profit. Any house price in any location can be predicted with minimum errorby giving appropriate dataset.
